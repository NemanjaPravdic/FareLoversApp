    <value>When providing services for booking flights and hotels, insurance and car rental services offered at the Portal (collectively referred to as “Travel Services”), we act exclusively as an intermediary. Therefore, our role and obligations are limited to mediation in connection with Travel services that will be provided by third parties, such as airlines, tour operators, hotels, insurance companies, car rental companies and other service providers (hereinafter referred to as “Service Provider” in each case).</value>

  <data name="UA_LABEL_1.1.2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Consequently, an agreement for actual provision of Travel Services (for example, a contract of carriage, an insurance contract, a rental contract) shall enter into force directly between you and the relevant Service Provider.

    <value>Using the Portal for purchase of Travel Services, you authorize us to negotiate with the appropriate Service Provider on your behalf, including the payment for these Travel Services, in order to ensure completion of a deal between you and the Service Provider.

  <data name="UA_LABEL_1.1.4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Responsibility for the actual provision of Travel Services purchased through Our mediation through the Portal is solely on a respective Service Provider.

Any claims that you may have in connection with the provision or non-provision of Travel Services should be addressed to the Service Provider.</value>

  <data name="UA_LABEL_1.1.5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you have the opportunity to express special requests (for example, on provision of special meals, facilities for the disabled or places for children) when booking Travel Services, we will transfer your request to an appropriate Service Provider.

    <value>In addition to mediation in acquisition of Travel Services, asdescribed in paragraph 1.1 above, the Portal also provides additional services(not being Travel Services), the for which we take responsibility. To make useof such additional services, you enter into contractual relations directly withus. In each case, we definitely inform you about the scope of our services andthat we offer our own services, rather than just mediate in buying third-partyservices. The content of our own services may change over time. When providingadditional services not stipulated in these Terms and Conditions, a detaileddescription of such additional services, as well as information about ourprices and additional conditions for booking and use, are provided to youduring the booking process.</value>

    <value>The agreement between you and a relevant Service Provider (clause 1.1.2) is regulated by the general conditions of a relevant Service Provider (conditions of carriage, transfer, insurance, etc.) issued by Service Provider. Such general conditions of a respective Service Provider will be communicated to you during the booking process. Since the conditions of Service Provider may include provisions on liability, cancellation, change of reservation and refund (if possible) and other restrictions, we recommend that you carefully read these conditions.</value>

You should know in advance the current departure time of your flight.
You should also be on time for check-in the time of which is indicated by airline. Airlines have the right to refuse boarding in case of coming late to check-in. Please note: some airlines offer online check-in on their websites and charge a manual check-in fee at the airport</value>

Combining two separate one-way tickets instead of buying one round-trip ticket is clearly indicated in the booking procedure. In case of cancellation, change or violation of air traffic, for example, as a result of strikes, and a change in the schedule, tickets are regarded independently of each other. The rules of each airline apply.
Flights with different booking numbers are always considered as independent trips</value>

    <value>Air tickets with several segments / rules of use
Your one-way or return ticket may consist of several segments. Under the terms of most airlines, such flight segments are used in a certain sequence. Otherwise, many airlines refuse to carry on subsequent segments of a flight (i.e. failure to use one segment of a trip may result in invalidity of the rest of a ticket).

If the child is 2 years old before the end of the trip, it is necessary to book a children’s ticket with a separate seat for the whole trip. Tickets for children under two years of age cannot be booked until the moment of birth, since the name and date of birth must exactly match the ones indicated in the passport. We do not reimburse expenses incurred if a ticket of the wrong type was originally booked.</value>
